# upsolving
Upsolving is a project related to competitive programming, it allows to find what problems have you tried in some online judges like Codeforces or TJU

To find what problems have you tried in Codeforces run the file 'codeforces_upsolving.rb':

 ruby codeforces_upsolving.rb

In case you got errors related to mechanize, try to install the gem using this command:

 gem install mechanize
